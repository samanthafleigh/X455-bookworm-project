              Fresh from a brief stay at a psych hospital, reporter Camille Preaker faces
              a troubling assignment: she must return to her tiny hometown to cover the
              unsolved murder of a preteen girl and the disappearance of another. 
              <br>
              <br>
              For years, Camille has hardly spoken to her neurotic, hypochondriac mother or to the half-sister 
              she barely knows: a beautiful thirteen-year-old with an eerie grip on the town.
              <br>
              <br>
              Now, installed in her old bedroom in her family's Victorian mansion, Camille finds herself identifying with 
              the young victims—a bit too strongly. Dogged by her own demons, she must unravel the 
              psychological puzzle of her own past if she wants to get the story—and survive this homecoming.

              <br>
          Darrow is a Red, a member of the lowest caste in the color-coded society of the future. Like his fellow Reds, he works all day, believing that he and his people are making the surface of Mars livable for future generations.
          <br>
          <br>
          Yet he spends his life willingly, knowing that his blood and sweat will one day result in a better world for his children.
          <br>
          <br>
          But Darrow and his kind have been betrayed. Soon he discovers that humanity already reached the surface generations ago. Vast cities and sprawling parks spread across the planet. Darrow—and Reds like him—are nothing more than slaves to a decadent ruling class.
          <br>
          <br>
          Inspired by a longing for justice, and driven by the memory of lost love, Darrow sacrifices everything to infiltrate the legendary Institute, a proving ground for the dominant Gold caste, where the next generation of humanity's overlords struggle for power. He will be forced to compete for his life and the very future of civilization against the best and most brutal of Society's ruling class. There, he will stop at nothing to bring down his enemies... even if it means he has to become one of them to do so.
